# Code Works 
#
# On the aircraft on the way to my holiday and realised that
# I didn't check that the spare calculation happens only
#  in a frame.  At the moment it would count two pins and if they add to ten then it would 
# count as a spare but the problem is that the 
#  program needs to know that if the spare is in the 
# frame
# 
# 
# Passes all test, (Modified one test to see if it 
# counts the spae within a frame)
#
# note- File 1 (Test.py).py original file given
