# BowlingGame
# Previously code was just reading pins.  Now code is added to read strikes.
#       def testJustPins(self): test adjusted to account for strike counting
#       def testForStrikesAtLastOfArray(self):  test created to check for out of index error when testing for strikes
#       

# this test case is just to test if it is reading counting and scoring the frames correctly
# the assert line would have to be different on the finished code.
