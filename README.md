# BowlingGame
# The code is refactored to just read and score for pins
# Strikes and Spares will be worked on in the next branch
# created homemade test at bottom of bowlingGame.py
# shows that the code works
# added     def testJustPins(self):                 to the test cases
#               self.game.roll(10)
#               self.game.roll(10) 
#               self.game.roll(10)
#               self.game.roll(5)   
#               self.game.roll(4)
#               self.game.roll(3)   
#               self.game.roll(1)
#               self.game.roll(5)
#               assert self.game.score()==48

# this test case is just to test if it is reading counting and scoring the frames correctly
# the assert line would have to be different on the finished code.
