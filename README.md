# BowlingGame
# This is the starting code, essentially the code that has been given at the start
# I have run the utitest module, got 5 errors
# After examination of the code I have come up with a plan
# The plan is to break it down into sections
# first - get the program to read and add up just pins code
# second - get the program to read and add up strikes code
# third - get the program to read and add up spares code
